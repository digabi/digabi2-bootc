# digabi2-bootc

This repository contains a proof-of-concept of a bootable Abitti 2 Candidate disk image. The image is based on [bootc](https://github.com/bootc-dev/bootc) project which is a modern way of creating Linux boot media.

The purpose of this proof-of-concept is to demonstrate how the image is being built to make it easier to give feedback of the solution.

Please send your feedback to Abitti support (abitti@ylioppilastutkinto.fi). As stated above, we don't actively monitor GitHub issues or pull requests.
